### [Recommendations]()
Based on the analysis I recommend the following actions:
- Always make sure to have the top selling products in stock, especailly during holiday season.
- Since the store delivery performance is astonishing, it might be neccssary to review the expected delivery time.
- It might be neccssary to recognize the top sellers or recognize them.
- Some sellers got a high amount of 1 star reviews. It might be neccssary to find out the reason and review the process.

### [Limitations]()

- I had to remove all null values from the revenue column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion. 
- In addition to that, I faced 601 products without any category. Because of limitations in the data provided, I wasn't able to add them to their respective categories.
